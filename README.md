# Open Business Solutions Website

This is a mirrored site of http://www.openbusiness.com.sg as a demo.

It is built with [DocPad](http://docpad.org/) - an awesome Jekyll-inspired static site generator.

All pages (Home, Features, About Us) are 100% static while only the search page is dynamic (nice).

From a CMS Administrator's point-of-view, you only need to add/edit jade or markdown files in /src/documents/pages and src/partials and voila!

## Run

1. Install [Node.js and Docpad](http://docpad.org/docs/install).
1. Clone from this [repo](https://github.com/kennyki/openb.git).
1. Execute `npm install` in the root dir (will install bower dependencies as well).
1. Execute `docpad run` in the root dir (`docpad.cmd` for Windows).
1. Browse to `http://localhost:9778`.
1. Enjoy.
